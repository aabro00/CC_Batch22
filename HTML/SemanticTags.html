    <h1>My 3 Favourite Countries</h1>
                <p>
                    I have travelled to many different counties over the last few years. Most of the being in Europe, so this list will contain only countries in Europe. Some of these places have really stood out to me. I'll list my top 3 countries I've visited and give you points on why they made the list. If only I could name them all, as each country has something special about it. Let me know what you think.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Slovenia</h2>
                    <p>
                Slovenia is an absolute gem. I haven't met someone who has travelled there and hasn't loved it. Being in between some of the cleanest and safest countries, Slovenia follows suit. I can't recommend visiting this country enough.<br><br> 
                    <strong>My Favourite Things:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lake Bled and the surroundings are stunning. I can't believe people live near here.</li>
                        <li>Ljubljana has some great architecture. The dragons around town are awesome.</li>
                        <li>Unpasterized milk vending machine/filling station. They had a setup in the middle of town where you could buy a bottle and fill it with milk right from the farm, at an unmanned machine. That will be a core memory.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                <h2>2. Poland</h2>
                    <p>
                    Ok, I can't lie and say I've spent much time here. <strong>But,</strong> this doesn't mean I can't list it! I went for the first time this summer and i loved it. I went to Krakow, and I didn't want to leave. There's something about the culture and nature of the people that I'm drawn to. There's many other cities I'm dreaming of going to in the future in Poland.<br><br>
                    <strong>My Favourite Things:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One word. <strong>Architecture.</strong> I love the different churches, buildings, and that magnificent square in Old Town. Some would say the Wawel Castle is ugly because of the various styles that were used, but I think it has so much character.</li>
                            <li>The history is so sad but so intriguing. There's only so much you can say about this one.</li>
                            <li>The foooood is amazing. It's so hearty and filling. Next time, I'm not eating for a week so I can fill up there. Please go and try the food... even the soup was incredible, <em>chef's kiss.</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                <h2>1. Czechia</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have been singing my praises of this country since the first time I went there back in 2019, when I was 18 and doing my first Euro trip. I loved it so much I went back again in 2022 and I plan to go back to see some other the other towns. Truly, Prague (Praha) has a piece of my heart. This would be somewhere I'd like to move to.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>My Favourite Things:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Would anyone be surprised if I said architecture again? You have to trust me on this one, though. The gothic style appeals to the core of my being. If you aren't familiar with the Prague Castle, <strong><a href="https://share.google/images/uA3hUnhH03gxg6y25">this</a></strong> is a great example of gothic architecture. They even have an ossuary in Brno built from human skulls... eerie? Yes. Would recommend? 100%</li>
                                <li>Food, food, food. I fell in love with one particular dish that hasn't left my mind. Garlic soup. Even typing it out now, my mouth is watering. I'm a <strong>huge</strong> garlic fan, so of course, I would die for this soup. If anyone has a good garlic soup recipe for me to try to make, let me know!</li>
                                <li>The energy of the capital city Prague. It's not like New York, the city that never sleeps. It has its own energy. I find it hard to describe, and I'm not sure it's something everyone else feels. I feel so drawn here, like I'm meant to stay.</li>
                            </ul>

                <h2>Final Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        As I wrote this, I realized how many great places there are in this world. How can one have a true favourite? May we all love and learn to appreciate our own backyard, because, who knows, maybe it's someone else's dream. What's your favourite countries you've been?
